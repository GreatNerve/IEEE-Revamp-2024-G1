# IEEE 2024 Website Revamp

Welcome to the IEEE 2024 Website Revamp project! To keep our workflow organized, we've structured our repository with three branches, each designated for a specific group. The branches are named in the format group-[group no].

## Uploading Your Code
Navigate to the web app directory and run the commands below:
```bash
git init 
git branch -M group-[group no] 
git remote add origin git@github.com:behldevansh/IEEE_Revamp_2024.git
git add -A
git commit -m "initial message"
git push -u origin group-[group no]
```
## Committing & Pushing
```bash
git add -A 
git commit -m "[commit message]"
git push -u origin group-[group no]
```
> [!NOTE]
>
> Always double-check that you are committing to the correct branch before pushing your code. This ensures that each group's work remains organized and isolated.
